## Homework Description


## Overview

For this assignment, I created  an employee directory with React. This assignment  required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

i created components to handle each part of the application and latter,i joined all of them to my root component APP

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
